# Fingerprint-Based-Blood-Group-Detection-System
An important factor of transfusion safety and medical diagnostics is blood group determination. Conventional techniques uses laboratory-based serological testing, which is time consuming, is prone to human error. As a non-invasive method, this project suggests an automated blood group detection system using deep learning and fingerprint recognition. Preprocessing and augmentation are used to increase the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that is trained on fingerprint images labelled with corresponding blood groups. To find unique fingerprint patterns connected to various blood groups, feature extraction techniques are used. The accuracy and dependability of the trained model are then assessed. This system provides affordable, and portable way to identify blood groups. Deep learning is used to reduce human error and improve accessibility in healthcare.
